# Notes web service

This is a small web service written in Go only for study purposes. It's intendend to be something like a Google Keep, but in the format of REST 
calls.

The test coverage is very small, because I'm still studying the testing framework.

I know and I'm sorry, the project may have some Java-ish terms or ideas.
